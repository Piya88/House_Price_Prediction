# House_Price_Prediction

In this project I have build ML model which will predict house prices. This will help sellers buyers and property dealers to get insight about house price and make informative decisions.
In Linear_regression file I have used all machine learning regression algorithms for prediction and will use final model which gives better prediction for a given data.
In Linear_reg file I have used deep learning algorithm neural network for the prediction of house price and tried to optimize our model by fine tunning hyperprameters of a model.
